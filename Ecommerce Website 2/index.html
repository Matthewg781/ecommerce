        <p>Join us here at The Gathering where we schedule events weekly. We ask our fellow planeswalers what they enjoy the most wheter it be commnader bingo, drafts, 
          or constructed tournaments. He are some of the events we host that have special prizes!</p>

          <h2>Modern Mondays</h2>
          <p>Modern is a constructed format and therefore adheres to the following constructed rules:
            Minimum of sixty cards
            No maximum deck size, as long as you can shuffle your deck unassisted
            Up to fifteen cards in your sideboard, if used
            With the exception of basic lands (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest, and Wastes),
             your combined deck and sideboard may not contain more than four of any individual card, counted by its English card title equivalent.
            Also, another note to mention, make sure you check the modern banlist in order for your deck to be legal</p>
        </div>

          <h2>Draft</h2>
          <p>At the start of booster draft, each player opens a booster pack and picks a single card. 
            (Don’t show the other players what you pick!) Then everyone passes the rest of their pack to player on their left, each player then picks a card from
             the pack they just received before passing again. This process continues until all the cards in those packs have been drafted. Then each player opens 
             a second pack, but this time, you pass the pack to your right. After all those cards are drafted, you do the same with the third pack, passing to the left again. 
            Repeat until you have a deck.</p>
        </div>

          <h2>Commander Bingo</h2>
          <p>Commander is an exciting, unique way to play Magic that is all about awesome legendary creatures, big plays, and battling your friends in epic multiplayer games! In Commander, 
            each player chooses a legendary creature as the commander of their deck. They then play with a 99-card deck that contains only cards of their commander's colors. Also, other 
            than basic lands, each deck can only use one copy of any card. During the game, you can cast your commander multiple times, meaning your favorite Legendary Creature can come 
            back!</p>

          <h2>Open Floor</h2>
          <p>On days we have an open floor, guests are allowed to play any format they wish. We have to keep the formats in their own designated area so when new planewalkers find The Gathering
            it will not be hard for them to find whay type of action is going on. Open floor also promotes players playing other TCG'S as well such as Yu-gi-oh or Pokemon. If TCGS arent your thing
          then we also have a plethora of board games players can enjoy like codenames or cards against humanity. Pretty much its free reign for the planewalkers here at The Gathering when its open floor day!   </p>
